    		<h2>A new empowered world</h2>
    		<p>Imagine a world where <b>every</b> Software Development team on the Planet is empowered so much so they are allowed to solve real problems for their real customers. They are hired and work not just to ship the code, not just to build and release features, but to do meaningful job and solve real problems for their customers. They are accountable not for the outputs, but for the outcomes, for the results, for the solutions of the problems.</p>

    		<p>This will make software much better, development teams and customers happier, businesses more profitable.</p>

    		<p>And the best thing is that <b>it's not just an absract image</b>! As for today, for the early 2023, <a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=882" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>about 10-15% of Product Software Development teams already work this way</a>. And due to "unknown" reason they build great products everybody knows about. To name a few: Stripe, Spotify, Slack, Netflix, Apple, Basecamp, Airbnb, GitHub, etc. It is not an accident, that these products are well designed, built and solve real problems for us &mdash; its a result of hard work of the teams working there. And this world desperately needs more such products to use and more such companies to work in.</p>

    		<p>How do these teams know about their customers problems and if suggested solutions properly nail these problems?</p>

    		<p>To get the answers on these questions they establish and keep different connections with their customers. They receive feedback from their customers constantly and improve on it.</p>

    		<p>And one of such feedback connections &mdash; is quantitative Product Analytics feedback.</p>

    		<p>As before only a few companies, a few teams could have known about and could afford building Product Analytics feedback tools (take a look <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/#instrumenting-metrics-and-events" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>how they do it in GitLab</a> for example). But now we can give all these teams ready to go, easy to use and easy to integrate with solution. Now they don't need to hire engineers to build such tooling for them at least to start with and understand the value of this connection. Now they can get an existing solution. For example &mdash; <b>Do They Use</b> Product Intelligence app. They can init the process of start being Data-Driven company. Not just Data, but most importantly &mdash; Driven. And not just in Marketing, not just in Business Intelligence, but also Data-Driven in Product.</p>
