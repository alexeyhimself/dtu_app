    		<h2>World of a better Connection between Software Development Teams and Product Consumers</h2>

        <p>We believe that the best solutions come out of deep, meaningful connections. Connections between producer and consumer, between team mates, between companies, friends and people in general. Together we can do much more, than we can even imagine.</p>

        <p>As one of such connections that desperate for attention we see Product usage feedback. Not a Marketing part of Product Analytics, but Product part. <b>Do they use</b> an app controls? <b>Do they use</b> the app features? And if yes, then how <b>do they use</b> them? And who of them? So we could ask why <b>do they use</b> them and optimize UX/CX/PX for them based on real usage data, based on this feedback, based on this real connection.</p>

        <p>There are lots of Marketing analysis tools in Product Analytics Tools market right now. But we don't see any Product analysis tools.</p>

        <p>At the same time we see, that the best Product companies (Stripe, Spotify, Slack, Netflix, Apple, Basecamp, Airbnb, GitHub, etc.) develop their own tools to solve this Product Intelligence problem (take a look <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/#instrumenting-metrics-and-events" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>how they do it in GitLab</a> for example).</p>

        <p>I.e. the problem exists, but companies solve it with dedicated teams and self-made tools. But if you have no resources for building feedback system yourself then you fated to fly blind. And with high probability to fail.</p>

        <p>That's why we decided to make <b>Do They Use</b> app. We want more Products to succeed. We want more Products with great UX/CX/PX.</p>

        <p>We want that every single entrepreneur, every team, every company on the Planet could bring more Product Intelligence into their Products. We want them to get ready-to-go solution, connect it in minutes and with minimum efforts to their apps and bring more Product Intelligence into their Products. Neither dedicated department, nor special qualification, nor high budgets are required anymore. No matter what size your team is, now you can get Product analysis, that precious connection to your consumers easily.</p>
