				<h2>Problem that Do They Use app helps to solve</h2>
				<p><b>Problem</b> &mdash; is that software development teams don't know what features, elements and options their users use in their digital Products. They add features or elements or options to their apps and they have no clue if their users actually using them.</p>
				<p>This lack of quantitative information leads them to <b>another problem</b> &mdash; to a huge waste of time and money on development of digital products. Teams waste their time and money flying blind if they don't instrument and apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Product Intelligence</a> for their software products. And this includes not only Marketing analytics tools (like Google Analytics) but more importantly &mdash; Product analytics tools.</p>

				<h2>What's happening</h2>
				<p>Practice shows [<a href="https://youtu.be/oazvsSsB4bk?t=844" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1</a>][<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/before-you-plan-your-product-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2</a>][<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/be-comfortable-killing-your-features/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3</a>] that in average only about 15-20% of product features is being used by 80% of highly paying customers. And the problem is that Product companies and Product teams without Product analytics don't know which 15-20% of their product features are being used by those valued customers &mdash; so they have to spend their time, money and energy on supporting those 80-85% of features that no one or only free users use.</p>

				<p>This 19-th century Marketing quote is still true if we don't instrument and use analytics for our products:</p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
				  <p class="mb-0"><i>"I am convinced that about one-half the money I spend for advertising is wasted, but I have never been able to figure out which half" [<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/04/11/advertising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">i</a>]</i></p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>We have the same problem with uninstrumented Products as well. Uninstrumented product &mdash; is a huge waste on product design, software development, testing, operations and management processes &mdash; because in this case teams have to guess. And practice shows, that chance of successfull guess in software development is only 10%. That's why we have so many failed startups, products and features that don't fly. Only 1 of 10 features that team builds solves the problem nice way from UX point of view, it is exactly what customer wanted. Other 9 of 10 features are not that good at all.</p>
				<p>This leads to degradation of customers UX, to experience rot, to higher churn rates, lower upsales, etc. I.e. this waste leads to even more wastes and raises high viability risk for the whole Product and even for a Product company.</p>

					<h2>How companies solve this problem today</h2>

					<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h3>Netflix, Stripe, Spotify and 15% of alike best Product companies in the world</h3>
				<p>Take a look <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">how they do Product Intelligence at GitLab</a>:
					<ul>
						<li>they have a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dedicated Product Intelligence team</a>;</li>
						<li>this team uses Google Analytics for Marketing analysis;</li>
						<li>this team <b>develops and supports their self-made tools</b> for front-end (Snowplow) and back-end (Service Ping) analytics for Product analysis.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Why do they develop these Product analysis tools (Snowplow and Service Ping) by themselves? Because:
					<ul>
						<li>there are no such tools in the market right now (and there was no 3 years ago when GitLab started) &mdash; that's why today teams need to organize data collection and analysis by themselves;</li>
						<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">they want to become #1</a> in their market by 2030 &mdash; and they know that they can't build #1 product in the market without Product Intelligence tooling.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h3>The rest 85% of Product companies in the world</h3>
				<p>Years of observations from Product people show [<a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=951" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">4</a>][<a href="https://youtu.be/A9wx91rVTms?t=1869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5</a>] that only about 10-15% of software development teams make and use tooling both for Product and Marketing analytics. Both make and use. Both Marketing (before purchase) and Product (after purchase). These teams work in a real Agile software development lifecycle with deployments to production for several times a day or a week &mdash; that's why they need real data feedback to make data-driven decisions for their digital products.</p>
				<p>Teams who don't apply tooling, they don't do it because of the number of reasons:
					<ol>
						<li><b>Ignorance.</b> Management knows "what features to build", "what customers and users want" &mdash; so they don't need to be data-driven and they don't need these tools;</li>
						<li><b>No experience.</b> Practice shows [<a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=951" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6</a>] that 85% of teams in the world don't work in true Agile software development lifecycle (they work in a "waterfall" even if they have "Agile rituals") &mdash; and they just don't know how to be data-driven and how it works, because they have never been working this way;</li>
						<li><b>No resources.</b> Development and usage of analytics tools is a side-project. Teams have their products to build and they do not have resources of time and people to implement their own tooling. And due to #1 and #2 reasons managers don't ask them to solve this "we have no data" problem;</li>
						<li><b>Sales-driven.</b> What <a href="https://youtu.be/TRZAJY23xio?t=1542" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steve Jobs mentioned in his interview in 1995</a> is still true: product-driven startups grow and they become marketing-driven and sales-driven companies. From Product companies they become Process companies. And such companies are not a place to work for the talanted Product people &mdash; so they leave these companies and companies loose those sense and skills of Product development.</li>
