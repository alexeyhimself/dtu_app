				<h2>Job To Be Done that Do They Use app is hired to do</h2>
				<h3>About JTBD</h3>
				<p><b>Problem &mdash; is a huge waste of time and money while developing digital products.</b> Product software development companies and teams waste their time and money flying blind if they don't instrument and apply Product Intelligence for their products. And this includes not only Product Marketing analytics tools (like Google Analytics) but also Product analytics tools.</p>

				<p>Practice shows [<a href="https://youtu.be/oazvsSsB4bk?t=844" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1</a>][<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/before-you-plan-your-product-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2</a>][<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/be-comfortable-killing-your-features/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3</a>] that in average only about 15% of features is being used by 80% of highly paying customers. And the problem is that Product companies and Product teams without Product usage analytics don't know which 15% of their product features are being used by those paying customers &mdash; and they have to spend their time, money and mental energy on supporting those 85% of features that no one or only free users use.</p>

				<p>This 19-th century quote is still true if we don't instrument and use analytics for our products Marketing:</p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
				  <p class="mb-0"><i>"I am convinced that about one-half the money I spend for advertising is wasted, but I have never been able to figure out which half" [<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/04/11/advertising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">i</a>]</i></p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>But we have the same problem with uninstrumented Product software development as well. Uninstrumented product &mdash; is a huge waste on product design, development, testing, operations and management processes &mdash; which leads to degradation of customers UX, higher customers churn, lower upsales, etc. It leads to even more waste and it raises high viability risk for the whole product and even for a product company.</p>

				<h3>How companies solve this problem right now</h3>
				<h4>GitLab and 15% of companies</h4>
				<p>Take a look <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">how they do it in GitLab</a>:
					<ul>
						<li>They have a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dedicated Product Intelligence team</a>;</li>
						<li>This team uses Google Analytics for Marketing analysis;</li>
						<li>And this team <b>develops and supports their self-made tools</b> for front-end (Snowplow) and back-end (Service Ping) analytics for Product analysis.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Why do they develop these Product analysis tools (Snowplow and Service Ping) by themselves? Because:
					<ul>
						<li>There are no such tools in the market right now (and there was no 3 years ago when GitLab started) &mdash; that's why you need to organize everything yourself;</li>
						<li>And <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">they want to become #1</a> in their market within the next 7 years &mdash; and they know that they can't build #1 product in the market without Product Intelligence.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h4>The rest 85% of companies</h4>
				<p>Many years of observations from Product people show [<a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=951" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1</a>][<a href="https://youtu.be/A9wx91rVTms?t=1869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2</a>] that only about 10-15% of software development teams make and use tooling both for Product and Marketing analytics. Both make and use. Both Marketing (before purchase) and Product (after purchase). These teams work in a real Agile software development lifecycle with deployments to production for several times a day or a week &mdash; that's why they need real data feedback to make data-driven decisions for their digital products. And they don't make and use tooling because of the number of reasons:
					<ol>
						<li><b>Ignorance.</b> Management knows "what features to build", "what customers and users need" &mdash; so they don't need to be data-driven and they don't need these tools;</li>
						<li><b>No experience.</b> Practice shows [<a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=951" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1</a>] that 85% of teams in the world don't work in true Agile software development lifecycle (they work in a "waterfall" even if they have "Scrum rituals") &mdash; and they just don't know how to be data-driven and how it works, they have never been working this way;</li>
						<li><b>No resources.</b> Development and usage of analytics tools is a side-project. Teams have their products to build and they do not have resources of time and people to implement their own tooling. And due to #1 and #2 reasons managers don't ask them to solve this "data problem";</li>
						<li><b>Sales-driven.</b> What <a href="https://youtu.be/TRZAJY23xio?t=1542" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steve Jobs mentioned in his interview in 1995</a> is still true: product-driven startups grow and they become sales-driven companies. From Product companies they become Process companies. And such companies is not a place to work for talanted Product people &mdash; so they leave these companies and companies loose those sence and skills of Product development.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>What we offer as a solution</h3>
				<p>We offer a Plug&Play (same as Google Analytics does) app both Cloud-based (we host) and Self-hosted (you host) &mdash; so software development teams could start making product analytics and see what really happens with their products right now. No dedicated software development team is required for that task anymore.</p>

				<p>To learn more take a look at:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="app.html">Try Do They Use demo account</a>. It monitors itself usage and shows you your usage of demo account in realtime.</li>
					<li><a href="src/customer/demos/iframe_app_local.html">Try single page demo</a>. First half of this page contains "your (monitored) simple app" and last half contains Do They Use (monitor) app &mdash; so you can see how it works this way;</li>
					<li><a href="how-to-use.html">How to setup for your app</a>. Read this if you want to try this app for your web app right now.</li>
