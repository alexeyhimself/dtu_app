				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">JavaScript SDK</h2>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an <a href="https://github.com/alexeyhimself/dtu_sdk_js" target="_blank" data-dtu="link: open source SDK">open source JavaScript SDK</a> that already covers all most popular default interaction elements in HTML on the Internet (and it is ready for new pull requests). That's why now you are all-packed to get started with analytics for your web app for 1-2-3 as it is described in <a href="#how-to-use" data-dtu="link: how to use">"How to use" section</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">We host or you host</h2>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This service is available both in Cloud (we host) and in Docker containers (for self-hosted installations).</p>

				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">Google Analytics Tags are the same?</h2>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Google Analytics</b> &mdash; is a tool for Marketing and SEO teams. It helps them with conversions evaluations. It helps to get answers on questions like:</p>
					<ul class="font">
						<li>Do we have visitors on our website?</li>
						<li>If yes, which pages do they visit? And how many times?</li>
						<li>How many of them?</li>
						<li>How much time do they spend on each page?</li>
						<li>Did they view the page, did they scroll?</li>
						<li>Which page to page paths do they go?</li>
						<li>Do they "convert" (signup, buy, download, leave a email, etc.)?</li>
						<li>Where do they come from (organic search, advertisements, social networks, etc.)?</li>
						<li>Where do they come from (country, city)?</li>
						<li>What platform do they use (desktop, tablet, mobile)?</li>
						<li>What browser do they use?</li>
						<li>What is their screen size?</li>
						<li>What is about retention, engagement and lifetime value?</li>
						<li>etc.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such kind of questions. For abstract "they".</p>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Do They Use</b> &mdash; is for Product teams. It helps teams to do what matters from Product and UX points of view. Answers on what to develop and why based on real usage data.</p>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, take a look at this screen of "Brawl Stars" smartphone game. It has more than 20 active controls:</p>
				<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wv4ko8jn5qq4ykv/brawl-stars-main.jpg?raw=1" style="min-width: 541px; max-width: 100%; border: 1px solid gray;" class="image">
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do They Use" service helps teams to get answers on questions like:</p>
				<ul class="font">
					<li>Do they use all these elements?</li>
					<li>Which elements do they use most often? Which ones they never use?</li>
					<li>Which elements do most of the users use? Which ones are barely used by anyone?</li>
					<li>What options do they choose most often? Which ones they never choose?</li>
					<li>Does our new feature or web element gets traction? How it goes?</li>
					<li>What elements and features need our attention the most (both because of high or low usage)?</li>
					<li>What elements and features started to have anomaly of usage: too high / too low usage? Maybe we released some bug there?</li>
					<li>Who of them actually use this? Are they are real buying customers or they are just free trial users, leads or simply visitors?</li>
					<li>etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such kind of questions. For exactly known who "they" are and why you should care at all (because of users and users groups segregation).</p>

				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">Vision for the service. Where it goes</h2>
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hierarchy.</b> As for now service monitors only web elements usage. Stats are flat (not hierarchical) and have no visual comparison to each other (to see which elements are used the most and which the least). That's why next steps are to display hierarchical models of data (for example button "Cancel" is on that page in that place, it has its unique path &mdash; so you could know exactly which "Cancel" button in stats) and show elements usage volumes compared to each other (on sankey diagrams).</p>
				
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Data.</b> Interacting with elements users choose options and enter data. We want to display analysis for the data as well. For example, to answer on questions like: "Which options are most often selected in dropdown list and which never selected?".</p>
				
				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Features usage.</b> Elements here and there &mdash; are the parts of more global things &mdash; features. Features could be tagged and monitored and analysed as well. Same as elements features are hierarchical items.</p>

				<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Users.</b> Okey, someone uses that element or feature or enters that data into the input field. Why should we care at all? Maybe it's just QA or PM or UX designer or Sales or Marketing team interacts with your app or service in prod. We want stats to include UID(s) and UGID(s) &mdash; so you could filter only users and users groups that matter or exclude users and groups that irrelevant. Don't optimise something just because "someone uses this". Know who uses "this" and optimise for those who matters.</p>
