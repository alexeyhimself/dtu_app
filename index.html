				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">JavaScript SDK</h2>
				<p class="font">There is an <a href="https://github.com/alexeyhimself/dtu_sdk_js" target="_blank" data-dtu="link: open source SDK">open source JavaScript SDK</a> that already covers all most popular default interaction HTML elements (and it is ready for new pull requests if you want to contribute). That's why now it is easy as 1-2-3 to get started with the analytics for your web app as it is described in <a href="#how-it-works" data-dtu="link: how it works">previous section</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">Host anywhere</h2>
				<p class="font">Service is available both Cloud-based (we host) and Self-hosted (you host). Read <a href="how-to-use.html">how-to use</a> page for more information of both types of installation and usage.</p>

				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">What's the difference with Google Analytics</h2>
				<h3>Google Analytics &mdash; is for Marketing</h3>
				<p class="font"><b>Google Analytics</b> &mdash; is a tool for Marketing and Product Marketing. It helps teams with conversions evaluations. It helps to get answers on the questions like:</p>
					<ul class="font">
						<li>Do we have visitors on our website?</li>
						<li>If yes, which pages do they visit? And how many times?</li>
						<li>How many of them?</li>
						<li>How much time do they spend on each page?</li>
						<li>Did they view the page, did they scroll?</li>
						<li>Which page to page paths do they go?</li>
						<li>Do they "convert" (signup, buy, download, leave a email, etc.)? And how many?</li>
						<li>Where do they come from (organic search, advertisements, social networks, etc.)?</li>
						<li>Where do they come from (country, city)?</li>
						<li>What platform do they use (desktop, tablet, smartphone)?</li>
						<li>What browser do they use?</li>
						<li>What is their screen resolution size?</li>
						<li>What is about retention, engagement and lifetime value?</li>
						<li>etc.</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="font">Such kind of Marketing questions. <!--For abstract "they".--></p>
				<h3>Do They Use &mdash; is for Product</h3>
				<p class="font"><b>Do They Use</b> &mdash; is a tool for Product Development and Product Management. It helps teams to do what matters from Product and UX points of view. It helps to get answers on questions "what to develop and why" based on real usage data.</p>
				<p class="font">For example, take a look at this screen of "Brawl Stars" smartphone game. It has more than 20 active controls:</p>
				<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wv4ko8jn5qq4ykv/brawl-stars-main.jpg?raw=1" style="min-width: 541px; max-width: 100%;" class="image">
				<p class="font"><b>Do They Use</b> app helps to get answers on the questions like:</p>
				<ul class="font">
					<li>Do they use all these elements?</li>
					<li>Which elements do they use most often? Which ones they never use?</li>
					<!--li>Which elements do most of the users use? Which ones are barely used by anyone?</li>
					<li>What options do they choose most often? Which ones they never choose?</li-->
					<li>Does our new feature or web element gets traction? How it goes live?</li>
					<li>What elements need our attention (because of high or low usage) the most?</li>
					<li>What elements started to have anomaly of usage: too high or too low usage? Maybe we released some bug and now we have such anomaly there?</li>
					<!--li>Who of them actually uses this? Are they real buying customers or they are just free trial users, leads, your employees or simply visitors?</li-->
					<li>etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="font">Such kind of Product questions. <!--For exactly known "who they are" and why you should care at all (thanks to users and users groups segregation).--></p>

				<h2 class="margin-top-50 margin-bottom-40">Vision for the service. Where it goes</h2>
				<p class="font"><b>Hierarchy.</b> As for now service monitors only web elements usage. Stats are flat (not hierarchical) and have no visual comparison to each other (to see which elements are used the most and which the least). That's why next steps are to display hierarchical models of data (for example: for which of "Cancel" buttons is this stats for?) and show elements usage volumes compared to each other (on sankey diagrams).</p>
				
				<p class="font"><b>Data.</b> When users interact with elements they choose options and enter data. We want to display analysis for that data as well. For example, to get answers on questions like: "which options are most often selected in dropdown list and which never selected?". So, you have not "based on database it is checked now", but "how many and how often do they check this" (in our example with "Brawl Stars" game: not just "number of users with currently selected El Primo brawler", but "how often do they choose El Primo brawler? Is he popular? Who is the most popular for the selected time period among the selected range of users? Who is the least?").</p>
				
				<p class="font"><b>Features usage.</b> Elements here and there &mdash; are the parts of more global things &mdash; features. Features must be tagged and monitored and analysed as well. And the same as elements, features are hierarchical items.</p>

				<p class="font"><b>Users.</b> Okay, someone uses that element or feature or enters that data into the input field. Why should we care at all? Maybe it's just our QA or PM or Designers or Sales or Marketing or Support teams interact with the app or service in production? We want stats that include our, specified UID(s) and UGID(s) &mdash; so we could filter only users and users groups that matter or to exclude users and groups that irrelevant to us. We don't want to optimise something just because "someone uses this". We want to know who exactly uses "this" and optimise for those users groups who matter to us in this case at this time. For example, "to optimize UX for users from accounts that bring 80% of revenue" &mdash; is a clear user group to analyse and focus on.</p>
